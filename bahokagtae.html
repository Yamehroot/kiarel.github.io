        <p>A name is worth a thousand conversations. Hi my name is Kiarrel Jean Inso Himaya 19 years old I was born on January 25, 2004 at Pajac,Bukid-Bukid Lapu-lapu City. We are six siblings in the Family Martin,Nichole Kent, Shane, danmar and Junryl I'm the oldest child. My Parent's name is Danilo and Marichu Himaya. My hubbies are singing,watching KDrama and also my favorite is  Eating hihi.I reflect varied personality including ambitions and the quality of generosity and thoughtfulness. I am also well determined individual yet pleasantly calm.I encourage everyone to fight for what you desire goal in life and believe  in,and doing it through God because nothing great comes easy and with God nothing is impossible all things are possible in his word just believe that God has a porpose of everything just trust him.When the time is right I. The lord will make it happen.</p>
        <p>And Now let's start my story Where we can say Life is like a flower Not all times are beautiful and fragrant. Im kia I live in Pusok Lapu-Lapu City and studied at Pusok  elementary school when I was young I loved to sing but They said my voice was not beautiful but I didn't listen to them because I really wanted to sing I also loved acting before I always get caught by my classmates I'm acting on my own self  HHAHA When I was in grade 3 I saw the first boy who made my heartbeat  faster and gives me butterflies char HHAHHAH. He was my first crush I always followed him and I wanted to see him because first crush dzuhh saya ba naman and it's almost 3 years ago HAHHA and I was in grade 6 that time I  experience being bullied by my classmates because of my chubby body. They used to bully me because they said I was fat and ugly. .HAHHAHA Isn't it fun, isn't it fun? To make a long story short, Im in high school already.</p>
        <p>I'm  so happy. Because my causins told me that  High school is fun and excitement because there are all the fun things to make memories and that's why in curiosity I'm grade 7that time I  meet my first bf  lynmer ops HHAHA I only met him on my fb HAHA Ang saya ba naman HAHA He was my first boyfriend in my whole life. I loved him and we were together for a long time but for some reason we broke up. We are also to young for that so thats why we broke up and I was in grade 9. This is where the big test in my life came. Where did it change me a lot. 
        June, when  my friends influence me to cut in class at first. I'm fine because We were late then and due to the extreme strictness of our school, we didn't go to the school so we decided to go to cave spring where we studied char HAHA we decided to go to sea . Until my parents found out. I haven't been going to school for almost 2 weeks and they're calling me to school with my cousin , which happened very badly. I was scared and ran away. I didn't know where I was going. My best friend Caren accompanied me. We ran away. We both don't knew where we were going. I didn't go home anymore and I just go home to my friend almost 2 months ago and my parents couldn't handle my attitude, they took me and what I don't know is that I'm going to  to Mindanao with my mommy to stay away to my friends and maybe I will change and that's why I went to Mindanao and by the grace of God I continued my studies there and finished Senior high and by the grace of God he changed me and told to myself that.I am the one yet different from the whole.I am me, but I am everything, and everyone.I do, I listen, and I am nothing; yet everything.I am the waves, the stars, the flesh and blood.I am the trees, the hide and the bone.
        <p>I am a mess and I am accomplished
        I am the word and the silent scream
        I am pain, and the in between
        I am a misplaced word and poetry
        I am a song and lack of melody
        I am never ending and a dead end
        I am empty yet filled to the brim
        I am the tongue that everyone speaks
        I am the forgotten tongue that never repeats
        I am the rhyme that catches on
        I am the abstract that never lets on. Be who you are be confidently beautiful with the heart.</p>
        
        <p>I humble dedicated this little effort of mine recapitilating my life in my own simple words.</p>
